# NOTES:
#
# On the first CI iteration, we let it update CMake/CTest and do the
# outer submit to the TDD dashboard.  This provides some detail on how
# the outter configure is being done and should provide some useful
# info.  However, for now, we turn off CDash submits to the outer TDD
# dashboard because currently it would submit worthless no-op results
# every LOOP_INTERVAL (e.g. 1 minute).  To be able to do the submit of
# the outer results we would have to make some tricky modifications to
# the CTest driver script so that the outter TDD driver could detect
# when at least one build case was done and if it was then do the
# submit in one shot at the very end.  I think you can do this but it
# would require some work.
#
# Above, we only install the offical version of CMake/CTest once on
# the first CI iteration.  We do not reinstall CMake over and over
# again to save time and there is little value in doing so;5B.
